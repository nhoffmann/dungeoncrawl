# dungeoncrawl

This repository follows an implementation of a roguelike as tought in [Hands-on Rust, Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/). 
The game is built on top of [bracket-lib](https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib). This is mainly for me to learn Rust and dabble with game development.

Find a basic overview what the game will be about in the [DesignDocument](./DesignDocument.md) (as suggested by the author of Hands-on Rust).
